# session_info

`session_info` outputs version information for modules loaded in the current session,
Python, the OS, and the CPU. It is designed as a minimum measure to increase
reproducibility and provides similar information as `sessionInfo` and
`devtools::session_info` in R.

## Motivation

`session_info` is particularly useful when conducting exploratory data analysis in
Jupyter notebooks. Listing the version numbers of all loaded modules after
importing them is a simple way to ensure a minimum level of reproducibility
while requiring little additional effort. This practice is useful both when
revisiting notebooks and when sharing them with colleagues. `session_info` is meant to
complement more robust practices such as frozen virtual environments,
containers, and binder.

## Installation

`session_info` can be installed via `pip install session_info`. It does not depend on a package
manager to find version numbers since it fetches them from the module's version
string. Its only dependency is `stdlib_list`, which is used to distinguish
between standard library and third party modules.

## Usage

`session_info` can be used from a script like so:

```python
import math

import natsort
import pandas
import session_info


session_info.show()
```


Output:

```
Session information:
-----
natsort             7.1.1
pandas              1.2.2
session_info        1.0.0
-----
IPython             7.23.0
jupyter_client      6.1.12
jupyter_core        4.7.1
-----
Python 3.9.2 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb 21 2021, 05:02:46) [GCC 9.3.0]
Linux-5.11.13-arch1-1-x86_64-with-glibc2.33

```

The default behavior is to only output modules not in the standard library,
which is why the `math` module is omitted above (it can be included by
specifying `std_lib=True`). To include not only the explicitly imported
modules, but also any dependencies they import internally, specify `dependencies=True`.

When `session_info` is invoked from a Jupyter Notebook,
the output is concealed in `<details>` tags
and will only show when clicked.
Since this saves visual real estate,
any modules imported indirectly as dependencies
will be included by default
and it looks like this:

If you prefer to show the session information without the HTML tags,
you can use `session_info.show(html=False)` in the notebook
to get the same output as in the first example above.

`session_info` can also write the module dependencies
to a `requirements.txt` file,
which is compatible with `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`.

## Background

`session_info` started as minor modifications of `py_session`, and as it grew it
became convenient to create a new package. `session_info` was built with the help of
information provided in stackoverflow answers and existing similar packages,
